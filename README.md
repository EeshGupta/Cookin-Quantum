# Cookin-Quantum

Goal: To optimize the quantum circuit for implementation of Shor's Algorithm.

Project Updates: 

8/15/2019 : Quantum Simulator ready by the end of week, Documentation to be done in future ; Quantum Circuit is taking more timr than expected. But needs to be done for comprehensive understanding of QFT and Shor. Aug 31 is still an achievable deadline for implementation of SHor's algo (Project 8)
