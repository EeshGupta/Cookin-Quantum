# Cookin-Quantum

Goal: To optimize the quantum circuit for implementation of Shor's Algorithm.

Project Updates: 

8/15/2019 : Quantum Simulator ready by the end of week, Documentation to be done in future ; Quantum Circuit is taking more timr than expected. But needs to be done for comprehensive understanding of QFT and Shor. Aug 31 is still an achievable deadline for implementation of SHor's algo (Project 8)
8/16/2019 : BIG WIN! In terms of programming, complete Quantum simulator is ready and Grover is done as well; Study Scedule is a bit behind but a great leap today. Need to get started on QFT b4 the week of 25th. Looks achievable with small but effective deep work sessions of (1.5-2 hours) Good work! Aug 31 is still on
